I'm totally new to LÖVE and Fennel, so I borrowed a lot of the boilerplate from
his entry to the [[https://itch.io/jam/lisp-game-jam-2018/results][Lisp Game Jam 2018]], [[https://gitlab.com/technomancy/exo-encounter-667][EXO_encounter 667]]. His post, [[https://technomancy.us/188]["in which a
game jam is recounted further"]], also served as excellent guidance in navigating
the API's for LÖVE as well as a few other excellent Lua libraries, listed below.

** [[https://github.com/rxi][rxi]]

Of [[https://github.com/rxi/lume][lume.lua]], which provides some very pleasant functional constructs such as
=map=, as well as typical linear interpolation and vector math. lume is released
under the MIT License.

** [[http://kiki.to/][Enrique García Cota]]

Of [[https://github.com/kikito/bump.lua][bump.lua]], a much simpler library for collision detection than the one
provided by LÖVE.

** [[http://clintbellanger.net/][Clint Bellanger]]

Of the [[https://opengameart.org/content/boxy-bold-font][Boxy Bold Font]] that I used in this game.

I really did fall in löve with the LÖVE API's.
